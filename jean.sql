For the NPV() function, we do not include anything at Time 0, which is what is happening today/now. This is because you are trying to find the present value of all the expected cash flows in the future. At time 0, the present value of what you have would be $300. So you do not need to find the present value of $300. \n\nI think what is tricky about this question is that there is no month 6, even though the question asks for \"take the series of money at the end of each month for the 6 months). Therefore, something to take note is just that for NPV() whatever that is happening \"Now\" at Time= 0 is not included in the NPV() calculation. However, for IRR() it is included.

I suppose that you have already set a custom print area (Select cells you would like to print -> \"Page Layout\" -> \"Print Area\" -> \"Set Print Area\").

To work around that, you can try \"custom scaling options\" (\"Print\" -> \"Scaling\" -> \"Custom scaling options\"). You will see two options, \"Fit to\" and \"Adjust to\".

I have tried this question and was also puzzled at the change in order and holding cost that was not mentioned in the question itself.

Usage of decision Model - The purpose of the decision model is to help users make more an informed & quality decision based on the data that are available. With an EOQ model for this question, we were asked to make changes to the annual demand only. However, I believe the solution also wants to show that the model will be effective even if other variables (order & holding costs) were to change.\n\n2. Reflecting on real-life scenarios - The changes shown in the solution could also possibly be done to mimic actual scenarios in the world as such costs are prone to fluctuate due to economic or industry influence.\n\n3. Purpose of the solution - I do believe the solution that you and I initially derived at are the answers to the actual question in the assignment 0. However, the illustration in the solution will serve as a good model for us to consider for our project purposes.\n\nNot sure if the above will provide some ideas on why the solution was done this way but I do believe that these are the few intentions of the solution. I am also curious if what I thought is the real intention and I guess we can only clarify the exam answering style with the professor. \n\nCheers and have a great weekend!',_binary '0',_binary '0',NULL,'2018-08-25 16:09:39',NULL,NULL,6.84,NULL,3.42,15,NULL,NULL,_binary '0',15,NULL),(19,57,17,2,NULL,'Hi Ashley, hope this reply finds you well.

I believe the solution wants to show that the model will be effective even if other variables (order & holding costs) were to change. Reflecting on real-life scenarios, the increases shown in the solution could also possibly be done to mimic actual scenarios in the world as such costs are prone to fluctuate due to economic or industry influence. Furthermore, with a greater amount of EOQ, the average inventory of the company raises, the increase could possibly suggest the additional amount of resources (e.g. space, labor, insurance) required to carry or hold the inventory. I feel that such an illustration in the solution will serve as a good model for us to consider for our project purposes. \n\nThe above are some thoughts of mine on why the solution was done this way and I am also curious if what I thought is the real intention and I guess we can only clarify the answering style with the professor.

The competition is not as crazy as on the lower end of the market, but there has to be some effort from the brand to distinguish itself from the rest to justify its higher prices.\n\nAs such, I would say that pricing is dependent on the hotel chain\'s strategy in the long run, and how it plans to capture its specific target market.

The table for \"Price-inelastic Demand\" just shows the scenario if the occupancy is not affected by room rates. However, this model is unrealistic as price goes up, the amount of that good demanded will go down. This calls for a more realistic \"Price-dependent Demand\". The demand does not necessarily have to be inelastic below $400 and elastic above $400. This is determined by surveys or empirical studies and we treat it as given and out of our control.\n\n2. The idea is to check how much can variable cost to increase to maintain the same profit margin of 43% when occupancy increases from 65% to 80%. We do not assume varibale cost to be $20. It is a hypothetical amount which results in a profit margin of 46%. By using goal seek in the manner you explained, we get $37. This tells us that, we can afford a raise in varibale costs (e.g. rising utility prices) of at most $17 per room before having a profit margin worse than before.\n\n3. Yes, however all the cost must be fixed. In this case, the cost curve is a horizontal straight line and the profit curve moves in the same way as the revenue curve. This means that the ratio of profit to revenue increases as revenue increases.\n(Try it out! Remove VarCost and Govt Levy)\nHowever, once there is variable cost, the cost curve is not straight anymore and the profit and revenue curves do not move together anymore.

The lookup function has 2 ways to use it. a) lookup value, lookup vector, result vector b) lookup value, array. \n\nWe are taught (a) because (a) provides the flexibility that the 2 columns (lookup and result) are not side by side (i.e. in a table). The lookup vector can be on 1 sheet and the result vector can be on another sheet; the result vector just takes in the relative position from the lookup vector.\n\n(b) is pretty much useless. Lookup has to be in ascending order for it to work. You are better off using vlookup (also has to be in ascending order). The only difference is vlookup allows you to return multiple columns. Lookup array can have more than 1 column but the result vector will always be from the last column.\n\ne.g. in cell A1, enter 1.8\ncell b1 =LOOKUP(A1,C1:E10)\ncell c1 to c10 (0 to 4.5 with 0.5 interval)\ncell d1 to d10 (1 to 19, odd numbers)\ncell e1 to e10 (2 to 20, even numbers)\n\nThe result you get will be 8. If you delete col E then you will have 0 as a result. You need to change the array to c1:d10 to get a result of 7.\n\n2. vlookup is vertical lookup not value (hlookup is horizontal). The table array in vlookup has to be at least 2 columns (1 for lookup and 1 for result). You can select col A:H but put 4 in the argument to return col D for example. IMPORTANT: lookup value ALWAYS has to be on the left of the results you want to get.\n\n3. match has to be used with index to lookup for things.

But in the case where you are looking for a certain result from a long list of data in excel, how are you going to use INDEX alone? That is why we use MATCH under row_num and column_num of the INDEX function. From the examples that we did, the lookup_array under MATCH function can only be referenced to either a single column or row. So it corresponds to using the MATCH function and referencing the row heading into INDEX\'s row_num and same goes for the column_num. \n\nYou can try by creating a simple example (similar to the car eg in class). Input \"orange\", \"apple\" and \"banana\" into cells B1, C1 and D1 respectively. Input \"NTUC\", \"Cold Storage\", \"Sheng Shiong\" into cells A2, A3 and A4 respectively. In cells B2:D4, you may input random numbers as the prices of the goods in different supermarkets. So let\'s say you want to know how much an apple cost in Cold Storage. Your formula will be -> =INDEX(B2:D4,MATCH(A3,A2:A4,0),MATCH(C1,B1:D1,0)). You should get the same number under cell C3.  Note that under INDEX\'s row_num, the MATCH\'s lookup_array only includes the supermarkets (inputted as rows) while the column_num only include the goods (inputted as columns) as MATCH\'s lookup_array. \n\n(2) VLOOKUP function itself has restrictions. We are unable to use VLOOKUP and drag across other cells because the column number will not change. If only using VLOOKUP, we will have to manually change the column number. That is why we use MATCH function within VLOOKUP. If you refer to the Echo Office Supplies file > Proto worksheet, cell H21 has =D21*VLOOKUP(D21,$G$5:$J$10,MATCH(H$20,$G$20:$J$20,0)) if you use the combination. Without combination, it\'ll be =D21*VLOOKUP(D21,$G$5:$J$10,2). If we just use the VLOOKUP function and drag across other cells, the col_index_num which is 2  will stay as 2 for all other cells. This then makes the function in the rest of the cells inaccurate because it is not always column 2 that you want your results to be returned from. In that example, column 2 of the lookup array is for widget, so if you drag across, you are still referring sprocket and gizmos projected sales in relation to the widget price per bulk quantity. \n\nHope this helps!',_binary '0',_binary '0',NULL,'2018-09-15 20:10:04',NULL,NULL,4.25285,NULL,4.04,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '0',308,NULL),(438,48,436,2,NULL,'Does your example looks like this?\n\nRate       Nper=1\n3.00%         ?\n3.25%         ?\n3.50%         ?\n3.75%         ?\n4.00%         ?\n4.25%         ?\n4.50%         ?\n4.75%         ?\n\nThen it\'s correct that \"rate\" is your column input, and you should leave your \"row input\" as blank, because in \"colum input = rates\" will alter the output of \'Nper\' by inserting different rates into the original formula.\n\nHow does your answer look like?

To make things simpler I will compare the differences in the following ways. So firstly for LOOKUP vs VLOOKUP functions, LOOKUP function lets you search for a specific data/information you want in a row or a column and then the function would return you a corresponding data in ANOTHER row or column. For example, suppose I have 3 columns (say A: Fruit Name B: Mass C: Price). If I want to know the price of a watermelon, I simply just need to lookup the value (in this case my cell containing watermelon), go to column A, and specify that Excel return the result vector in column C. VLOOKUP function is almost as similar to LOOKUP, just that instead of allowing you the flexibility you have in LOOKUP by searching rows/columns, it only can allow you to search vertically in a row and returns data from left to right. That is, starting from the leftmost column. INDEX and MATCH functions can be thought as the opposite of each other; INDEX returns you an item/name from a specific position in the table while MATCH will return you the relative position of your data. When used together, MATCH function can be used to replace the [row_num] and [column_num] in your INDEX functions. To understand which functions are more appropriate, in the end it still eventually boils down to what the question is asking you for but if you take a look at the class exercises such as the Echo Supplies question, you will actually see that various function combinations can still derive you the same value/item.

It allows us to search for data in a row or column while vlookup allows us to search vertically in a row and returns data in the leftmost column indicated.

You can combine INDEX and MATCH to create a more dynamic lookup function than VLOOKUP.

However, the benefits of using the LOOKUP function is that the position of the data of interest and the position of the lookup data can be placed anywhere and can be even placed in a different sheet.\nThis is in contrast to VLOOKUP, where the position of the lookup data must be in the leftmost column. Also, the data of interest must be in the same table as the lookup data. However, the benefit to using VLOOKUP over LOOKUP is that you can choose to use either an approximate match or an exact match. If an exact match is chosen, the data would not have to be sorted. However, there is a drawback to VLOOKUP in that there is only one type of approximate match. In the class example, we could not find the school with a starting salary above $4,000, but could only find the highest starting salary beneath $4,000. \nThis is where MATCH comes in. MATCH on the other hand has 2 forms of approximate matches, on top of an exact match. This means that we will be able to find the largest value that is less than our lookup value, and the smallest value that is greater than the lookup value. However, MATCH only returns the relative position of the item in an array, and not the actual value itself. We would have to then use INDEX to find the value of the item that we are interested in. An analogy would be that MATCH acts like a GPS guide by giving the â€œco-ordinatesâ€ of the data, and INDEX would be like a map by telling you what data is stored at that location. \nIn summary, these 3 lookup formulas (LOOKUP, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH) have their strengths and drawbacks. To know which formula to use would be different on a case-by-case basis, depending if the data is sorted, the position of the data, and the type of approximate match required.

For your question on CRITBINOM, this function actually returns the inverse of the Cumulative Binomial Distribution. I.e. for a specific number of independent trials, the function returns the smallest value (number of successes) for which the cumulative binomial distribution is greater than or equal to a specified value.\n\nFor example, when we throw a coin for 9 times, the questions asks the probability of getting a 3 heads. Then is you use BINOM.DIST, it gives you the result of 30% let\'s assume. And it is a possibility number. On the other hand, if the question is asking, what\'s the number of heads you can get when you know there\'s 30% of chance you could get it? Then you use CRITBINOM function which reflect to you a real number, 3 (heads). The two functions a like a contrary of each other. it\'s like, when you know a, you can use BINOM.DIST to get b. When you know b, CRTIBINOM can help you to get a.\n\nThe difference bewteen Binomial distribution and Poisson is, based on my own understanding, Binomial distribution is calculating the number of successes within a fixed number of trials. When using Poission distribution, you can have infinity number of trials but all of the trials must be within a certain period of time. For instance, like the example prof used in class: for BINOM, you could imagine 9 trails of throwing the coin, the number of successes is the number of heads you get. For Poisson, is like, average you can get 3 heads by throwing your coin in 1 hour, but you can also throw the coin as many as you can within the 1 hour, not neccessary to be 3 ( a fixed number), when time\'s up, you could not throw it anymore',_binary '0',_binary '0',NULL,'2018-09-25 09:53:12',NULL,NULL,6,NULL,4.04,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '0',647,NULL),(662,159,647,2,NULL,'Continue with the last part of my answer, I just realized that the explanation of Poisson distribution might not be clear.

Imagine that there are 3 doors (1 with a winning car) and you had to choose one. Your original choice gives you odds of 1/3. There are two doors left, which have, together, a 2/3 chance of winning the car. This is because you have no information on the choice yet and based on that, the 3 doors should have an equal probability of leading you to win the car. Now, 1 out of the 2 that you did not choose, was opened and found to not lead you to the car. However, the fact that one of the doors was opened doesnâ€™t change the odds. Those odds will still be 2/3, hence it will be better to change your decision. Of course, it is instinctive to assume an equal probability but I think it would only apply to a situation where you have absolutely no clue about the choice (which was what happened before you chose the door). In the Monty Hall exercise, we had information that 1 of the door is not the prize winner so we can make a more informed choice of changing decisions because it leads to a higher probability in the long run. Such effects are more evident in the long run rather than a few simulations because it is aggregated to be 2/3 chance if you choose to change over time.

There are also many online tutorials and information that allows you to learn the simple VBA commands which you are free to utilise and at your disposal which can be found easily using a Google search. Once you get the hang of the basics, it is more or less different permutations of your basic knowledge. However, refering to your question, you must know what is your purpose in learning VBA, what would you forsee using it for and you could then decide if you should prioritise learning it!',_binary '0',_binary '0',NULL,'2018-09-25 11:28:13',NULL,NULL,4,NULL,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '0',669,NULL),(671,58,0,1,'Count','Lets say we have a table with numbers and text, but I want to get the count for items in the table, because the count function only counts cells with numbers in them, how do i get excel to count both the text and numbers together?',_binary '1',_binary '0',_binary '0','2018-09-25 15:10:29','2018-09-26 15:10:24','2018-09-25 15:10:29',3,0,1.88,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '0',0,NULL),(672,57,671,2,NULL,'Hi ieatveryslow, since count function only counts cells with numbers in them, you could possibly explore countif function and count the number of times a particular text that you want to know by setting the range and its criteria.

In this case, I would say that it is possible to find out the total counts of text and numbers by highlighting the entire array that you wish to count and the number will show in the green box at the bottom of the excel page.

It is said that the first document that is opened uses the calculation mode with which it was last saved. Documents that are opened later use the same mode.

If you open Manual1.xlsx and then open Auto1.xlsx, both documents use manual calculation. I suppose it means that if your buddy received a manual workbook and opens it first before his usually automatic workbook, it will be indicated as manual for all workbooks. Hence, your settings is always dependent on the first workbook that you open.

After that, using the RAND() and =LOOKUP functions, we match it with the CRF table to get new values for simulation.\n\n2nd method involves the use of resampling discrete or continuous data.\n\nWe use the =SMALL function for discrete data, or =PERCENTILE function for continuous data. The =SMALL function provides us with the k^th smallest value, as if the raw data are sorted. The use of RANDBETWEEN() as k to returns us an random integer from the discrete data resampled. For continuous data, =PERCENTILE provides us with the k^th percentile from the continuous data provided. Using RAND() here as k provides us with a random integer as the k^th percentile which might provide us with a different value from raw data as =PERCENTILE() uses interpolation. For both resampling of discrete or continuous data, there is no need to collect frequency count \n\n3rd method involves the use of inverting discrete and continuous distributions. We learnt to invert uniform, binomial and poisson distributions for discrete data, and also uniform, normal and exponential distributions for continuous data. \n\nI think the 1st method should be used when the probabilities or number of occurences are provided to us. Using the data given to us, it is easy for us to produce a CRF to =LOOKUP the numbers generated from RAND().\n\nThe 2nd method should be used when we have a large pool of raw data, discrete or continuous. The large size of raw data makes it hard to calculate the probabilities or CRF, instead we use =SMALL or =PERCENTILE to provide us with the value generated from RAND() or RANDBETWEEN(). \n\nThe 3rd method should be used when we are provided with the different probability functions. These can be discrete probability functions like binomial distributions, Poisson distributions, or continuous like exponential and normal distributions.

For Method 2 of the Data Sim exercise, using the LARGE() function instead of SMALL() should still work and allow us to perform the resampling. \n\nIt is useful to understand that both functions require the same inputs, but perform slightly different calculations with them. Both require 1) array (essentially the range of values) and 2) k, k being an integer. \n\nIn the Data Sim exercise, we have a 5 x 5 table, with each cell containing a value from 1 to 4. Using SMALL(), we input the 25 cells as the array we want to refer to. In k, we input RANDBETWEEN(1,25). One way to understand what SMALL() does is to imagine it ranking the 25 cells in ascending order based on their values (i.e 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, â€¦, 4, 4). So we have the smallest value at position 1, and the largest at position 25. Next, k gives the exact position SMALL() should reference to extract the value needed. For example, if k = 3, SMALL() will return the 3rd smallest value in the defined dataset (i.e. third number in the list).\n\nApplying this understanding to LARGE(), we start to see why using this function works as well. Instead of returning the smallest number, LARGE() returns the biggest value. So if k = 3, LARGE() returns the 3rd biggest value in this case. \n\nFor the purposes of resampling, we simply want to award equal probability to choosing a value between 1 to 4 based on the distribution in the 5 x 5 table provided.

The hotel only has a capacity of 150 rooms, that is why the line stops at 150 and does not extend over 150. Regarding your second question, when prof said that the data in column C does not represent the \"real demand\", it means that by looking at the sales data, we are unable to determine the \"real demand\". This is because even if demand is 160 rooms, sales will still be at 150 rooms because that is the maximum capacity of the hotel. So, the sales data does not reflect \"real demand\" which could be at 160, 180, or 200, etc. This is also why when we plot the red line, we only select data up to 149 i.e. exclude 150, because when sales = 150, we cannot infer the \"real demand\".

The Running Cost calculation takes reference to Table 2-2 and the row called \'Cumulative Running Cost\'. The first lookup references the \'Year Sold\' and finds the cumulative cost. The second lookup references the \'Year Bought\' and finds the cumulative cost. What\'s happening is that only the cumulative cost incurred when you own the machine is taken into account. Take Lookup1 - Lookup2 to arrive at the running cost.\nWhy do we do this for running cost?  \nWhen you buy the 4 year old machine from the other guy, the other guy has already paid the cumulative cost of $86,000. You just need to pay the running cost of it for 1 year, which is $110,000 - $86,000 = $24,000 (also represented by H5). That\'s why the most efficient strategy is stated, and will cost $37,312 based on this formula.

In I12 and 13, you calculate \"years and months\" between start and today. If start is 15 Dec 78 and today is 13 sep 17, it calculates a difference of 38 years 8 months (464 months). However, 15 Dec 78 + 464 months is 15 August 17, almost a whole month short of today.  Then you take the total time (44 years or 528 months), subtract the previous calculation (which, as noted, is almost a month off) to get the remaining time (528-464=64 months) and add that to today. In short, it looks like a rounding error caused by rounding the first difference down to the nearest month.  Solution -- probably depends on exactly what you are trying to do. My approach would probably be more:  1) Add 44 years to start date [=EDATE(B1,44*12)] to get end date.  2) Formulas like in I12 and I13 to get the difference between now and start and now and end. Recognize that you will still have to consider rounding error as you decide how to round these to whole months.  2a) I might completely redo some of these formulas. For example, I might do I12 as =YEAR(B2-B1)-1900 to get the number of years between those two dates. To get months in I13, =MONTH(B2-B1). Formulas like that might be easier to work with than the combination of INT() and YEAR() and DATEDIF() and... that you are currently using.

As a sidenote, when creating the second drop down list, I had to name each range of Codes with the City name- so when looking at \'City Capacities\' sheet, highlighting A2:A12 yields the name \'Carlsbad\' as can be seen in the Name Manager.  For Cities like \'Chula Vista\' which contains a space, I had to name its respective range as \'ChulaVista\' without the space.  Excel wont let me name a range with spaces inbetween, and the second drop down list won\'t work unless the spelling of the named range is exactly the same as the city in the data validation list.  So, I had to remove all the spaces between the city names on the data validation list for the City column in order to get the second drop down list to function correctly.  Not a big deal, but having the respective spaces between the city names like \'Chula Vista\' and \'City of SD\' looks better than \'ChulaVista\' or \'CityofSD\'.  Is there any way to keep my dropdown lists functioning all while having the City dropdown choices retain their spaces?

Another example, Row 11 > 30 days, Row 12 < 30 days, but both row also fall under unit A-03-5, due to have row data for this unit > 30 days (row 11), therefore, this unit will count.

W4 is TRUE too because it is yes. W5 is FALSE because it is no. and so on... {TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;TRUE;TRUE} press ESC so that the formula dont make the changes of your calculation. now select this part and press F9: MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0) it shows the row position number of the first Unit No. A-03-1 is shown as 1 because it is found in row 1 of E3:E21. so is the next 2 cells because they are the same unit number. A-03-2 is then found in row 4 of E3:E21 (E3 is row 1, E4 row 2, E5 row 3, E6 row 4). and so on. {1;1;1;4;4;6;7;7;9;9;11;12;13;14;14;14;14;14;14} combine the IF and MATCH formula, and it will only return the first row number WHEN column W is yes. press F9 IF(W3:W21=\"yes\",MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0)) so the 3rd value is FALSE because column W is No: {1;1;FALSE;4;FALSE;6;7;7;9;FALSE;11;FALSE;13;FALSE;FALSE;14;14;14;14} the FREQUENCY formula helps to find out the number of times each unique number appears. it has 2 arguments and we have completed the first part above (known as data_array). that is like a raw data you want to count from. now we need to set what numbers do we wish to count. we actually want to count how many times 1 appears. how many times 2 appears. and so on. so we need a range from 1 to 19. why 19? because you have 19 rows in total inside your data. select this and press F9: ROW(E3:E21) you get numbers from 3 onwards. because E3 is in row 3.  {3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15;16;17;18;19;20;21} and that\'s not what we want. we want it from row 1 onwards. and that was your question; why minus row(E3)+1? 3 - ROW(E3) is 0. +1 makes it start from 1. so select this and press F9: ROW(E3:E21)-ROW(E3)+1 you now get from 1 to 19: {1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15;16;17;18;19} you can of course use ROW(E1:E19) straightaway. but it is a preference a lot of us have because that\'s the range your data is in. and since E1 is empty inside your data, there is a chance you might delete it someday and the formula won\'t work. Select the whole FREQUENCY formula now and press F9: FREQUENCY(IF(W3:W21=\"yes\",MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0)),ROW(E3:E21)-ROW(E3)+1) so this is now counting for the number 1 (row 1 of E3:E21 where A-03-1 is), we have 2 instances of it. for number 2 (row 2 did not appear in our data_array if you refer above, since the MATCH formula only returns the first row number it finds), there are no counts for it. number 3 did not appear since it was \"no\". number 4 appeared once (A-03-2 only have 1 record which is yes). and so on... {2;0;0;1;0;1;2;0;1;0;1;0;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0} now, as long as the number above is more than 0, i can say that it is a unique Unit No. the slightly longer way to write an IF formula is to input whether is it equals to something, greater than something, and so on. i omitted it because i know numbers that is NOT EQUALS TO 0 is FALSE. so the slightly longer way is to add in the one in red: FREQUENCY(IF(W3:W21=\"yes\",MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0)),ROW(E3:E21)-ROW(E3)+1)>0 but without >0, anything above 0 will still show as 1 (1 as in 1 unique Unit No) here. press F9. IF(FREQUENCY(IF(W3:W21=\"yes\",MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0)),ROW(E3:E21)-ROW(E3)+1),1) first 1 is 1 because 2 is >0. 2nd one is FALSE because 0 is not >0. and so on. {1;FALSE;FALSE;1;FALSE;1;1;FALSE;1;FALSE;1;FALSE;1;1;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE} lastly, the SUM formula sums up all the 1s.  and that gives you your unique count of unit numbers. i know that\'s a lot to digest. hope it helps.',4739128,'09-09-2017, 10:22 AM',NULL,'countif',5,4,4.5),(357,'Looking for Solution for Countif or similar formula',NULL,'Dear benishiryo, Wau....thank you for the detail and comprehensive explanation.

The actual one is confidential and huge (over 40 columns 650 rows, and 20+ sheets) it also has many macros and apart from column A and B all columns are full with calculations. It has been developed over years through many people.. some knew what they do some didn\'t, and so far no one made an effort to clear it up.. to add new rows we have a macro, but we can not add new columns, as some of the macros and calculations break. I also think it is not necessary for this calculation that I need to add in, but it could be done with a pivot table in my example, in the excel sheet I have it is not possible.  So: First column is strawberries or blueberries second column is random weight values. The third column decides if they are counted or not (0 or 1) the fourth column is =B*C and D2 is a SUM of D column.  In the C column for the strawberries there is a number, either 0 or 1 but for the blueberries it refers to other cells which are also 0s or 1s but this allows for the blueberries to be counted in cell D2 if we want them to be counted or to not be counted when we don\'t want them counted. (I need to keep it like that!) Now the complication is: for the blueberries in C column we refer to 2 other cells, one of them is \"Blueberries qtty\" the other one is \"Additional blueberries\". I would need to SUM the Blueberries but not the ones that are additional.  NO MATTER IF THE CELL VALUE IN C IS 0 OR 1 IT ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE THE SAME NUMBER (-4 in the example). There are Blueberries with Negative value in column B, so <0 doesn\'t work because the negative ones will be counted but they are additional so they shouldn\'t be. (Row 7 in the example) Formula would be something like: =SUMIF(A5:A13,\"Blueberry\",B5:B13) but this doesn\'t take into consideration that I don\'t want the \"Additional blueberries\" counted.  So in my head it should look something like: =SUMIFS(B5:B13,A5:A13,\"Blueberry\",C5:C13, ???PLEASE HELP???) so how do I express in excel language: C column, whichever row, cell contains =$L$9 cause \"=$L$9\" doesn\'t seem to work.. and so far nothing else I tried. If there is another formula that would do and fit the my excel sheet as I explained above, then I\'m open for it just please explain what your formula does.. I\'m not really good in excel and I would like to learn.

Or do you need a new formula that does not yet exist? You have a formula in your file labelled \"Average Annual Cost per unit\" (G51:G55). This formula calculates (unit cost x # units for market) / (number of years) / (# units for market) You are multiplying by number of units then dividing it back out, so this is equivalent to (unit cost) / (number of years) I cannot think of any business value for this calculation unless you are trying to allocate expenses over those years for accounting purposes. But if that\'s what you are doing, you wouldn\'t do it with unit costs, you would do it with total cost.

I think your second is actually two questions:  a.  To get the formulae to give a blank if there is no date in column H, surround it with an IF statement, like this (for J2):      Formula:                             =IF(H2<>\"\",DATE(YEAR(H2)+5,MONTH(H2),DAY(H2)),\"\")                                                                                                          This tells J2 to look at H2 and if H2 is not blank (<>\"\") then apply the Date formula.  If H2 is blank, the IF formula will return a blank (from the final \"\" ).  b.  The formatting from Conditional Formatting (CF) will always over-ride manual formatting, so you can\'t just turn a cell black.  There are two ways you could deal with this:(1)  When the award has been given, type \'Y\' or \'yes\' into the cell to overwrite the formula; the CF will then not apply so the cell will be un-shaded again and you can manually colour it black (or you could use CF to colour it black if the cell contains \'Y\').  (2)  If you want to keep the date, then insert another column beside the award column, in which you can type a \'Y\' or \'yes\' (or maybe the date the award was actually given, if that\'s what you\'re doing).  You can then use CF to colour the 5-yr/10-yr cell black.  For (1), use CF of \'Cell Value\' \'equals\' \'=\"Yes\"\' (or \'=\"done\"\' or whatever you want to use) then format with black fill.  For (2), the CF\'s a little different.  I\'ll assume your new columns are columns K and M (to the right of the 5-yr J and 10-yr L):<U+0095> Select your J range (J2:J100 or whatever)  <U+0095> Click \'Conditional Formatting\', then \'New Rule\', but this time choose \'Use a formula to determine which cells to format\'.  <U+0095> In the formula box, enter this:      Formula:                             =K2<>\"\"                                                                                                          <U+0095> Click \'Format\' then choose black fill.  Repeat with your L range and M2 in the formula.  Finally, an apology:  my brain obviously wasn\'t working correctly when I gave you my previous answer .  The second CF formula should have been \'Cell Value\' \'less than\' \'=TODAY()+365\' - as anghicole correctly pointed out!  I\'ve attached a file with all of the above working.

See my answer in the attached.  It uses VLookup to find the number associated with the letter, then Index(Match()) functions are needed to find the letter from the number.  Look at the formulas in the yellow cells.Working out grades.xlsx Now - this above system only works if each grade has the same weight.  Some teachers say they give 20% of the grade for homework and 50% for the final exam and 30% for weekly tests.  The above method does NOT account for the weighting of each because of math..   My last few years of teaching I converted every test, quiz, homework assignment etc to Student T scores.  You can average these suckers because the math works.  Here is the short method. Each test is graded.  Say it is a 75 point quiz.  I would find the average and standard deviation for all the tests.  Say the average was 60 and the standard deviation was 10.  Then I\'d convert these to Student T Scores where the Average Score was always (for every test) 50 and one standard deviation above average was 70 (in this example).  Now, when I averaged all the scores, because they reflected the standard deviation above aveage you simply average the Student T scores and it works.... The principal and most counselors never understood how I did this and just wanted me to give a % score but this is a much better way.  Note that IQ scores and SAT and ACT scores are like this because it is better!!!   I hope my attached works for you.  I also hope you read about using Student T scores to give grades.   Bottom Line was - I looked at all the other Math teachers grades and realized my scale was below theirs and was able to convert my letter grades to reflect the school\'s math department standards without bias.  I coula also look at a 55 and tell a student they were a half standard deviation above average on any assignment.

You have discovered that the way you set up your data makes a difference.  Excel works best if you collect data in a TABLE.  That is an area of cells with no blank rows or columns.  Each column head needs a name and each row is a record of data.  You decided to put each week(s) on a different tab and duplicate the layout.  Now a formula to gather all the sheets data into a single number is too hard  (I saw your formula that is HUGE).   If you reorganized your data in a better TABLE format you could filter and sort and even graph the data much better. I\'d make the first column a Labor Column that could have an Employee Name or Casuals (?) or M&I name or Student Name. The second column head would be Date (Pay date or date of transaction) The next column heads would be like you have on row 4 starting at column C of your sheets. I\'d make all this data into a single table on a single sheet.  Then I\'d use filters and sorts or Pivot Tables to give you the answers you need.

Therefore, I think I need a formula which will find the most recent contact where an assessment score has been entered.

Providing the numerical values within the lookup_array are sorted (which, since LOOKUP has the useful property of ignoring errors, will be in this case), then, if the lookup_value is not found within the lookup_array, the last numerical value which is less than the lookup_value will be returned.

Honestly, no one wants to re-type your data to try and solve your issue.  Additionally, we would only be guessing at how your data was structured, ie. formulas, formatting, etc.  Additionally, due to how some browsers behave, many of our members cannot see uploaded pictures/images.  Please do not take this route. Please attach a sample file that represents what you have. The structure of your attachment should be the same structure as your actual data. Any proprietary information should be changed. Include in the attachment any code you\'re currently using (whether it works or not) and an \"After\" of what you wish the output to be. To attach a file to your post,  click advanced (next to quick post),  scroll down until you see \"manage file\",  click that and select \"add files\" (top right corner).  click \"select files\" find your file, click \"open\" click \"upload\" click \'done\" bottom right. click \"submit reply\" Once the upload is completed the file name will appear below the input boxes in this window.

A-03-2 is then found in row 4 of E3:E21 (E3 is row 1, E4 row 2, E5 row 3, E6 row 4). and so on. {1;1;1;4;4;6;7;7;9;9;11;12;13;14;14;14;14;14;14} combine the IF and MATCH formula, and it will only return the first row number WHEN column W is yes. press F9 IF(W3:W21=\"yes\",MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0)) so the 3rd value is FALSE because column W is No: {1;1;FALSE;4;FALSE;6;7;7;9;FALSE;11;FALSE;13;FALSE;FALSE;14;14;14;14} the FREQUENCY formula helps to find out the number of times each unique number appears. it has 2 arguments and we have completed the first part above (known as data_array). that is like a raw data you want to count from. now we need to set what numbers do we wish to count. we actually want to count how many times 1 appears. how many times 2 appears. and so on. so we need a range from 1 to 19. why 19? because you have 19 rows in total inside your data. select this and press F9: ROW(E3:E21) you get numbers from 3 onwards. because E3 is in row 3.  {3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15;16;17;18;19;20;21} and that\'s not what we want. we want it from row 1 onwards. and that was your question; why minus row(E3)+1? 3 - ROW(E3) is 0. +1 makes it start from 1. so select this and press F9: ROW(E3:E21)-ROW(E3)+1 you now get from 1 to 19: {1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15;16;17;18;19} you can of course use ROW(E1:E19) straightaway. but it is a preference a lot of us have because that\'s the range your data is in. and since E1 is empty inside your data, there is a chance you might delete it someday and the formula won\'t work. Select the whole FREQUENCY formula now and press F9: FREQUENCY(IF(W3:W21=\"yes\",MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0)),ROW(E3:E21)-ROW(E3)+1) so this is now counting for the number 1 (row 1 of E3:E21 where A-03-1 is), we have 2 instances of it. for number 2 (row 2 did not appear in our data_array if you refer above, since the MATCH formula only returns the first row number it finds), there are no counts for it. number 3 did not appear since it was \"no\". number 4 appeared once (A-03-2 only have 1 record which is yes). and so on... {2;0;0;1;0;1;2;0;1;0;1;0;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0} now, as long as the number above is more than 0, i can say that it is a unique Unit No. the slightly longer way to write an IF formula is to input whether is it equals to something, greater than something, and so on. i omitted it because i know numbers that is NOT EQUALS TO 0 is FALSE. so the slightly longer way is to add in the one in red: FREQUENCY(IF(W3:W21=\"yes\",MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0)),ROW(E3:E21)-ROW(E3)+1)>0 but without >0, anything above 0 will still show as 1 (1 as in 1 unique Unit No) here. press F9. IF(FREQUENCY(IF(W3:W21=\"yes\",MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0)),ROW(E3:E21)-ROW(E3)+1),1) first 1 is 1 because 2 is >0. 2nd one is FALSE because 0 is not >0. and so on. {1;FALSE;FALSE;1;FALSE;1;1;FALSE;1;FALSE;1;FALSE;1;1;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE} lastly, the SUM formula sums up all the 1s.  and that gives you your unique count of unit numbers. i know that\'s a lot to digest. hope it helps.','4739128',4.5,5,4,'great. the FREQUENCY formula is a little hard to explain, so even inside the Tips and Tutorials under my Signature, I merely linked it to this video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUrI8hoj8BA&feature=plcp you can watch it instead of reading from my description here if it helps. a useful skill to learn when deciphering a complex formula is the F9 key to calculate. so try going inside the formula bar of this formula from your file and select the one i colored red: =SUM(IF(FREQUENCY(IF(W3:W21=\"yes\",MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0)),ROW(E3:E21)-ROW(E3)+1),1)) Press F9 to calculate and it shows you a bunch of TRUEs and FALSEs. so W3 is TRUE because it is yes.

Select the whole FREQUENCY formula now and press F9: FREQUENCY(IF(W3:W21=\"yes\",MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0)),ROW(E3:E21)-ROW(E3)+1) so this is now counting for the number 1 (row 1 of E3:E21 where A-03-1 is), we have 2 instances of it. for number 2 (row 2 did not appear in our data_array if you refer above, since the MATCH formula only returns the first row number it finds), there are no counts for it. number 3 did not appear since it was \"no\". number 4 appeared once (A-03-2 only have 1 record which is yes). and so on... {2;0;0;1;0;1;2;0;1;0;1;0;1;4;0;0;0;0;0;0} now, as long as the number above is more than 0, i can say that it is a unique Unit No. the slightly longer way to write an IF formula is to input whether is it equals to something, greater than something, and so on. i omitted it because i know numbers that is NOT EQUALS TO 0 is FALSE. so the slightly longer way is to add in the one in red: FREQUENCY(IF(W3:W21=\"yes\",MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0)),ROW(E3:E21)-ROW(E3)+1)>0 but without >0, anything above 0 will still show as 1 (1 as in 1 unique Unit No) here. press F9. IF(FREQUENCY(IF(W3:W21=\"yes\",MATCH(E3:E21,E3:E21,0)),ROW(E3:E21)-ROW(E3)+1),1) first 1 is 1 because 2 is >0. 2nd one is FALSE because 0 is not >0. and so on. {1;FALSE;FALSE;1;FALSE;1;1;FALSE;1;FALSE;1;FALSE;1;1;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE} lastly, the SUM formula sums up all the 1s.  and that gives you your unique count of unit numbers. i know that\'s a lot to digest. hope it helps.',4,3,660,83,0,0,0,0,1,10,10,0,NULL,366),(366,'List out the staff on leave on any one particular date according to sequence of entries','Hi everyone,  Can someone please help.

It has been developed over years through many people.. some knew what they do some didn\'t, and so far no one made an effort to clear it up.. to add new rows we have a macro, but we can not add new columns, as some of the macros and calculations break. I also think it is not necessary for this calculation that I need to add in, but it could be done with a pivot table in my example, in the excel sheet I have it is not possible.  So: First column is strawberries or blueberries second column is random weight values. The third column decides if they are counted or not (0 or 1) the fourth column is =B*C and D2 is a SUM of D column.  In the C column for the strawberries there is a number, either 0 or 1 but for the blueberries it refers to other cells which are also 0s or 1s but this allows for the blueberries to be counted in cell D2 if we want them to be counted or to not be counted when we don\'t want them counted. (I need to keep it like that!) Now the complication is: for the blueberries in C column we refer to 2 other cells, one of them is \"Blueberries qtty\" the other one is \"Additional blueberries\". I would need to SUM the Blueberries but not the ones that are additional.  NO MATTER IF THE CELL VALUE IN C IS 0 OR 1 IT ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE THE SAME NUMBER (-4 in the example). There are Blueberries with Negative value in column B, so <0 doesn\'t work because the negative ones will be counted but they are additional so they shouldn\'t be. (Row 7 in the example) Formula would be something like: =SUMIF(A5:A13,\"Blueberry\",B5:B13) but this doesn\'t take into consideration that I don\'t want the \"Additional blueberries\" counted.  So in my head it should look something like: =SUMIFS(B5:B13,A5:A13,\"Blueberry\",C5:C13, ???PLEASE HELP???) so how do I express in excel language: C column, whichever row, cell contains =$L$9 cause \"=$L$9\" doesn\'t seem to work.. and so far nothing else I tried.

To get the formulae to give a blank if there is no date in column H, surround it with an IF statement, like this (for J2):      Formula:                             =IF(H2<>\"\",DATE(YEAR(H2)+5,MONTH(H2),DAY(H2)),\"\")                                                                                                          This tells J2 to look at H2 and if H2 is not blank (<>\"\") then apply the Date formula.  If H2 is blank, the IF formula will return a blank (from the final \"\" ).  b.  The formatting from Conditional Formatting (CF) will always over-ride manual formatting, so you can\'t just turn a cell black.  There are two ways you could deal with this:(1)  When the award has been given, type \'Y\' or \'yes\' into the cell to overwrite the formula; the CF will then not apply so the cell will be un-shaded again and you can manually colour it black (or you could use CF to colour it black if the cell contains \'Y\').  (2)  If you want to keep the date, then insert another column beside the award column, in which you can type a \'Y\' or \'yes\' (or maybe the date the award was actually given, if that\'s what you\'re doing).  You can then use CF to colour the 5-yr/10-yr cell black.  For (1), use CF of \'Cell Value\' \'equals\' \'=\"Yes\"\' (or \'=\"done\"\' or whatever you want to use) then format with black fill.  For (2), the CF\'s a little different.

The formula might start something like this, which will give you the \'A\' for the Mon-Thu period:      Formula:                             =IF(AND(WEEKDAY(A2,1)>=2,WEEKDAY(A2,1)<=5,C2>8/24,C2<=17/24),\"A\",....                                                                                                         This assumes date in col A and time in col C - note that you don\'t need the separate day name column. Hope that helps. If you could say what you want for the other possibilities, we can build the rest for you as well.',4,14,115,20,3,2,0,1,0,0,2,0,NULL,619),(619,'Multiple IF and complicated VLOOKUP.','I am trying to combine some data from SAP system using spreadsheet with few TAB\'s.

( Which is Row No # 6 )  Then fix that row.  Step2:  Once the row 6 is fixed go to Column <U+0093>B<U+0094> and select value <U+0093>Six<U+0094>. And then fix this cell for another vertical lookup.  Step3:  Now, we need to find out a cell which starts with <U+0093>CHECK_<U+0094> but this should also occur in-between two cells which starts with <U+0093>CHECK1_<U+0094>  Please be remember that if there are two cell which starts with <U+0093>CHECK_<U+0094> ( In-between cells start with <U+0093>CHECK1_<U+0094> ), expected results should select which is very near to that fixed row cell  (Example <U+0096> lookup of <U+0091>23_twentythree<U+0092> )  (Please see attached picture with color representation )  Row No Column A Column B  Lookup Values Expected Results  1 1_One One  6_Six CHECK_Four  2 2_Two Two  11_Eleven CHECK_nine  3 3_Three CHECK1_Three  14_Fourteen CHECK_Fifteen  4 4_Four CHECK_Four  23_twentythree CHECK_twentyone  5 5_Five Five     6 6_Six Six     7 7_Seven Seven     8 8_eight CHECK1_eight     9 9_nine CHECK_nine     10 10_Ten Ten     11 11_Eleven Eleven     12 12_Twelve Twelve     13 13_Thirteen Thirteen     14 14_Fourteen Fourteen     15 15_Fifteen CHECK_Fifteen     16 16_Sixteen CHECK1_Sixteen     17 17_seventeen seventeen     18 18_eighteen CHECK_eighteen     19 19_nineteen nineteen     20 20_twenty twenty     21 21_twentyone CHECK_twentyone     22 22_twentytwo twentytwo     23 23_twentythree twentythree     24 24_twentyfour twentyfour     25 25_twentyfive CHECK1_twentyfive',5,38,267,12,11,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,NULL,908),(908,'Custom requirement using vlookup or Hlookup','','I created a formula that looks for the last word - \"CHECK....\" in column C based on the lookup value in column B.

I have searched high and low all night trying to solve my problem. I have a set of data from Student Subject selections for my school.   I have about 300 students and they have submitted preferences for 2018 subjects.  My data looks a little like this. I do have some specialist software that can assist in anaylising the data in various ways. But it\'s a bit clunky and I think it would be nice to be able to do some of this in excel too. I was hoping to be be able to make a table that looks like this I want the numbers inside the grid to represent the sum of students which have chosen both the subjects listed in the corresponding column heading and row label. Neither countifs or sumproduct seem to be able to do this. So the formula needs to be looking at the all the Choice columns from the table.

I have searched high and low all night trying to solve my problem. I have a set of data from Student Subject selections for my school.   I have about 300 students and they have submitted preferences for 2018 subjects.  My data looks a little like this. I do have some specialist software that can assist in anaylising the data in various ways. But it\'s a bit clunky and I think it would be nice to be able to do some of this in excel too. I was hoping to be be able to make a table that looks like this I want the numbers inside the grid to represent the sum of students which have chosen both the subjects listed in the corresponding column heading and row label. Neither countifs or sumproduct seem to be able to do this. So the formula needs to be looking at the all the Choice columns from the table.

In short I am trying to link an excel sheet for a user to pull data from a number of vendor reports that consolidates a number of tabs and sheets into one that the user can print off Monthly.  I have it all done but stuck in one piece.  In 3 spots on the reports there are changing fields in between others that only show data in the respective fields so the number of fields is always changing and when a value is present the 2 categories can have fields with the same name so lookup, index and match may pull from the wrong category at times.  IE if one Month there is no field listed for Processed in 3 Day on Rec. but it\'s there for Del, then it pulls the Del # into the Rec group.

Never use entire column/row with Index/Match (or for that matter for most formula, excluding SUMIF(s), COUNTIF(s) family).

There are about 20 different categories named A,B,C,D,E etc. and each category has several entries in Column A so that the total sum of entries is about 1000. All entries are in random order so A,D,G,H,A,A,A,B,B etc.  - I have a second Sheet2 with a Column A containing Package IDs labeled t1,t2,t3, etc and there are about 500 packages where each package occurs only once. (t1,...,t500). Furthermore, in Column B and the following I assign to each Package ID a respective capacity for the categories mentioned in Sheet1. This means that in B1 I denote for example that Package t1 can contain 6 units of items from category A. In C1 I would then denote that Package t1 can contain 3 units of items from category B. This is done for all 20 different categories and builds up the sheet.  -> What I am now trying to do is to link both sheets and write a Column B in Sheet1 which assignes each entry in column A to its respective Package from Sheet2. This would mean that since Package t1 can contain 6 units from category A the first 6 As in Column A Sheet1 are assigned to t1 in Column B Sheet1.  Is there anyone who can suggest an implementation for this problem in excel formulas? I was thinking of applying VBA but the complexity might not solve the problem in this case.

We need to update the list due to the fact that one postcode has many different suburb names so therefore we are given a list that looks like thishttp://imgur.com/0yv6ZMT  So we are trying to align the service providers per unique ID going horizontal not vertical  So far we have tried this formula without success  INDEX($B$2:$B$4847,SMALL(IF($D$4848:$D$11532=$D$2:$D$4847,ROW($D$4848:$D$11532)-ROW($D$4848)+1),COLUMN(A1)))  can anyone help with this?

The formula ends up being:      Formula:                               =DATEDIF(start date, end date, \"md\") + IF( AND( MOD( YEAR(end date) ,4)=0, MONTH(end date)=3, MONTH(end date) <> MONTH(start date)), 2, IF( AND( MOD( YEAR(end date), 4) <> 0, MONTH(end date)=3, MONTH(end date) <> MONTH(start date)), 3, 0))                                                       For your spreadsheet, use this:      Formula:                               =DATEDIF(B2,B8,\"y\")&\" anni \"&DATEDIF(B2,B8,\"ym\")&\" mesi e \"&DATEDIF(B2,B8,\"md\")+IF(AND(MOD(YEAR(B8),4)=0,MONTH(B8)=3,MONTH(B8)<>MONTH(B2)),2,IF(AND(MOD(YEAR(B8),4)<>0,MONTH(B8)=3,MONTH(B8)<>MONTH(B2)),3,0))&\" giorni\"                                                       If you want a formula which will give (for example) \'1 mesi e 3 giorni\' instead of \'0 anni 1 mesi e 3 giorni\' then use this:      Formula:                               =IF(B8-B2<0,\"data minore > data maggiore\",IF(DATEDIF(B2,B8,\"y\")>0,DATEDIF(B2,B8,\"y\")&\" anni \",\"\")&IF(DATEDIF(B2,B8,\"ym\")>0,DATEDIF(B2,B8,\"ym\")&\" mesi\",\"\")&\" e \"&DATEDIF(B2,B8,\"md\")+IF(AND(MOD(YEAR(B8),4)=0,MONTH(B8)=3,MONTH(B8)<>MONTH(B2)),2,IF(AND(MOD(YEAR(B8),4)<>0,MONTH(B8)=3,MONTH(B8)<>MONTH(B2)),3,0))&\" giorni\")                                                       Hope that helps (and that I\'ve finally got it right ).Edit: the formula should work for end dates up to the year 2100 (which isn\'t a leap year).

Issue: What formula would I use to do index matching to look up and count the number of products in a range?

Here\'s my example: I need a formula to reference the code in column A to look up the code in column D (the black bar is meant to visually represent that columns d-s are a different workbook) and count the number of x\'s (products) in range E:S. The number of products should be returned in column B (where the ? is). Unfortunately it wont actually be that easy because its going to be something like count the number of x\'s (products) in columns E:I and O:Y, meaning there is a break of 5 columns it would actually be counting (not represented in this example). I\'m not sure if that makes a difference for the formula.  Also, as you can see, the codes in column D are in no particular order. Preferably I would like to leave the data the way it is arranged and not have to sequentially order the codes. There are a total of 70 codes, but I would like the formula to reference 100 rows total, so rows 2:102. After code 70, no more codes are input. I just added a little buffer into the range.

The cells that will be highlighted will be dates so need that connections need to be made.   Attached is my sample worksheet. Any assistance would be helping.

Is there faster way to make excel read minutes/seconds instead of hours/minutes?  PROBLEM #2 - i have multiple tasks, the time to complete needs to be summed.    How many minutes did this person spend Closing on this date?  How many minutes did this person spend on the phone on this date?  Task #  Task Name/Cat         Date          Start Stop         Duration    1          Closing                 17-Apr 10:12 AM 10:14 AM 2:20              2          Phone                 17-Apr 10:14 AM 10:14 AM 0:24              4          Closing                 17-Apr 10:19 AM 10:46 AM 27:01      The Start and Stop Times are not accurate.    The Durations are accurate and I want to add up and make a pie chart.  but I can\'t get excel to see the times correctly and calculate.  Please help me!!!

Here my nerd self testing batteries. I\'m measuring the battery\'s maximum mAh capacity. Based on that information I can see how much these batteries actually hold when compared to the labelled capacity.  But, what I\'d like to do is find the batteries that have the closest capacity. Reason: A device only works till the first battery runs out. So if you have a device that runs two AA batteries, and one battery takes a 1940 mAh charge and the other a 1925 mAh charge, it will work until the 1925 mAh battery is depleted, leaving the other battery with some charge left. (Not a big deal, but for OCD\'s like myself, it ... is ...).  I\'ve attached the spreadsheet. The numbers that correspond to this question are in column H. (The measured mAh). I\'ve started this sheet to practice and \'doodle around\' with Excel to see if I could make it work, and so far I\'m pretty happy.  Now, finding a close match is easy however; the tricky part comes when more batteries are introduced. Let\'s say you\'re looking to find two pairs of AA batteries. You can simply take two batteries and have the closest match, but it may leave the other two batteries with a huge gap in capacity. (That we\'re trying to avoid here). Therefore it may be better to have two pairs that each have a slightly larger capacity gap ... and I\'m guessing what is being done here, is an \'averaging\' of battery capacities. Does this make sense?  The sheet will clarify some stuff. For an example within this post:  Battery #1, 2, 3, 4 have capacities of 1940, 1925, 1938, 1933 mAh respectively.  Battery 1 & 3 have the closest capacity with a difference of just 2 mAh. Great!  However, this leaves 2 & 4 with a relative larger gap of 8 mAh.  Now add two more pairs of AA\'s and the guess work for closest capacities between eight batteries becomes a large task. A formula that makes pairs for you would be a huge help.

I\'m measuring the battery\'s maximum mAh capacity. Based on that information I can see how much these batteries actually hold when compared to the labelled capacity.  But, what I\'d like to do is find the batteries that have the closest capacity. Reason: A device only works till the first battery runs out. So if you have a device that runs two AA batteries, and one battery takes a 1940 mAh charge and the other a 1925 mAh charge, it will work until the 1925 mAh battery is depleted, leaving the other battery with some charge left. (Not a big deal, but for OCD\'s like myself, it ... is ...).  I\'ve attached the spreadsheet. The numbers that correspond to this question are in column H. (The measured mAh). I\'ve started this sheet to practice and \'doodle around\' with Excel to see if I could make it work, and so far I\'m pretty happy.  Now, finding a close match is easy however; the tricky part comes when more batteries are introduced. Let\'s say you\'re looking to find two pairs of AA batteries. You can simply take two batteries and have the closest match, but it may leave the other two batteries with a huge gap in capacity. (That we\'re trying to avoid here). Therefore it may be better to have two pairs that each have a slightly larger capacity gap ... and I\'m guessing what is being done here, is an \'averaging\' of battery capacities. Does this make sense?  The sheet will clarify some stuff. For an example within this post:  Battery #1, 2, 3, 4 have capacities of 1940, 1925, 1938, 1933 mAh respectively.  Battery 1 & 3 have the closest capacity with a difference of just 2 mAh. Great!  However, this leaves 2 & 4 with a relative larger gap of 8 mAh.  Now add two more pairs of AA\'s and the guess work for closest capacities between eight batteries becomes a large task. A formula that makes pairs for you would be a huge help.  I know this sounds more like a mathematical question, perhaps it\'s not possible within Excel.
